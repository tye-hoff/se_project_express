# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

<<<<<<< HEAD
In this project, we focused on back end development. The primary focus was to sucessfully create a server for the WTWR application. Through this process I was fortunate enough to gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. In order to test how successful the flow of data, security, and deployment of the back end was, I used a few tools that were new to me.

## MongoDB -

The first of these tools to explore was MongoDB. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a document oriented format which offers both flexibility and scalability for many application styles. The design of MongoDB enables real-time data processing and analysis, making it suitable for applications like WTWR. This real-time data processing stores data in documents, which are similar to JSON objects; I found this style of database was quite easy to interact with because each analysis extracts useful information in regards to the flow of data in the project; furthermore, MongoDB's schema is perfect for storing structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, making it suitable for many different applications due to its adaptability. We implemented MongoDB due to its high availability and scalability, because it can handle large amounts of data and high traffic.

## Postman -

The next tool was Postman, Postman is an API platform that aids developer's ability to build, test, document, and manage APIs. It provides tools for sending and receiving requests and testing APIs. Postman was useful for the testing procedures required for the successful deployment of this application. It facilitates manual testing of the APIs by sending requests and viewing responses, which makes tracking requests, responses, and troubleshooting super simple to deal with.

## Further Goals -

<<<<<<< HEAD
The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
